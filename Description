Problem description
In many researches held on Heat exchangers it is specified that
effectiveness is the best way to measure its efficiency. So, in
such cases, it is of extreme important to find the best design at
which we get the Maximum effectiveness of Heat exchanger,
which is the objective of this work.
 To study the Effectiveness variation by varying the baffles
in cross flow heat exchanger. Computational [5] validation of
experimental data has rarely been conducted in the cross flow
heat exchangers. The current work aims to not only add to the
computational validations of cross flow heat exchangers [4]
but also to thoroughly investigate the flow physics. Heat
exchanger is well understood from a theoretical flow
perspective but not as well from a computational
aerodynamics perspective.
: Construction of Geometry.
This problem has three geometries namely,
1. Hot fluid section
2. pipe section
3. cold fluid section
The geometries of given problem are created by using
SOLIDWORKS software. The dimensions of the geometries
are:
Shell cross section: 130 x 100 mm
Shell inlet and outlet : 80 x 80 mm
Height of the shell : 400mm
Tube internal diameter =46mm,
tube thickness =2mm
Length of tubes =420mm
No. of tubes=3 
Setting physics of the Problem
Since in this problem consists of three phases we need to
select three physics, one for gas, second for liquid and another
for SOLID.
Physics selected for gas and liquid :-
 Three Dimensional Flow.
 stationary
 Constant density
 Steady Flow.
 Segregated flow model
 TURBULENT FLOW with K-Epsilon model.
Physics selected for solid :-
 Three Dimensional Flow.
 STATIONARY
 CONSTANT DENSITY
 Steady Flow.
 Segregated solid energy.
The Boundary Conditions
In this problem there are two inlet one for coolant other
for hot steam through the pipe, both are velocity inlet
type. Similarly there are two outlets in which pressure
outlet type for the hot steam (pipe fluid) and flow split
outlet type for coolant outlet. The solid pipe cross
section is given as symmetry type and remaining are
keep as a wall which are smooth, no slip and adiabatic.
The velocity at both the inlet is 0.05 m/s. the pressure
at the tube outlet is one atmosphere.
Coolant temperature =290k
Hot steam temperature = 420k.
Turbulent intensity is 5% for hot steam and 10% for
coolant liquid used. The length scale are 5mm and
10mm for steam and coolant respectively.
 CONCLUSIONS
The results states that simple modification in the
baffle plate arrangement and design gives the
significant changes in the effectiveness of the heat
exchanger. In case A and E, the baffle length ends
above and below the third tube, shows the good
effectiveness and less dead regions are recirculation
zones compared to the cases B and D. But in the
case of C, the pressure buildup at the baffle end and
so the recirculation zone is large. So if the tubes are
fully submerged and the uniform flow over the
tubes gives the better effectiveness.
